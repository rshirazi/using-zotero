## Intro to Zotero 5.0 for Citation Management

Materials prepared for an introductory workshop on using Zotero 5.0 for citation management, offered at the Graduate Center Library in Fall 2017.

*This workshop will help you install, configure, and get started with managing your citations using Zotero.*

## What is a citation manager and why should I care?

When doing research at the graduate level, it is important to be diligent about keeping track of your sources. This can be done with pen and paper in a dedicated notebook or on index cards. Or, you might just keep an Excel spreadsheet of all of the materials you are consulting for a project. 

Citation managers like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), RefWorks, and Mendeley help automate the process by working with your web browser to grab the information about a source (author, title, publication, etc.) with the click of a button. They can even be integrated into word processing software to **automatically generate properly formatted citations and bibliographies.**

## Introducing Zotero

created by RRCHNM; 
new, updated version
Zotero is best used in Chrome or Firefox. 

It has two pieces:

- the application, which you'll install on your computer
- a browser "connector" so that you can save to Zotero from your browser
  advanced uses (notes, indexing, tagging, etc.)

We'll call the citations you save in Zotero your **library**, but it is more like a database. You'll need to create a user account that will allow you to sync your library across multiple devices. Zotero stores your information centrally (we call this the Zotero server), and when you add or edit items in your library you will want to **sync** the changes to the Zotero server, so that your library is updated on all of your devices. 

*Note: the Zotero website is not the same as the Zotero application. The website allows you to access your library without installing the application, like if you are working in the library and just want to look up a reference that you'd saved earlier. **The online library doesn't have all of the features we'll be discussing in this tutorial.*** 

## Installation

1. Create an account on [zotero.org/user/register](https://www.zotero.org/user/register).
2. Download Zotero 5.0 for Windows or Mac on [zotero.org/download](https://www.zotero.org/download).

3. Install the Zotero connector for Chrome or Firefox, also on [zotero.org/download](https://www.zotero.org/download). 

## Getting Started

Before using Zotero for the first time, we need to set up our preferences and connect the standalone application to the browser connector.

### Configure

1. Open the Zotero application and navigate to the **Preferences** menu. On a PC, go to Edit > Preferences. On a Mac, go to Zotero > Preferences.
2. On the **Sync** tab, log in with your username and password
3. On the **General** tab, **uncheck** the option that says, "Automatically tag items with keywords and subject headings"
4. On the **Search** tab, click **Check for installer** and then **Install now**
5. On the **Cite** tab, select the **Word Processors tab** and check the option that says **Use Classic Add Citation dialog** (optional)

### Collect

There are many ways to collect citations into Zotero. We'll go over some of the more common methods just to get started. You'll notice that the different "translators" found across different databases and websites may cause the same reference to show up differently in Zotero.

1. Journal article in a database
2. Book through Google Scholar
3. Web site
4. Newspaper article
