# Intro to Zotero 5.0 for Citation Management
*This workshop will help you install, configure, and get started with managing your citations using Zotero.*

## What is a citation manager and why should I care?

When doing research at the graduate level, it is important to be diligent about keeping track of your sources. This can be done with pen and paper in a dedicated notebook or on index cards. Or, you might just keep an Excel spreadsheet of all of the materials you are consulting for a project. 

Citation managers like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), RefWorks, and Mendeley help automate the process by working with your web browser to grab the information about a source (author, title, publication, etc.) with the click of a button. They can even be integrated into word processing software to **automatically generate properly formatted citations and bibliographies.**
