## Introducing Zotero

created by RRCHNM; 
new, updated version
Zotero is best used in Chrome or Firefox. 

It has two pieces:

- the application, which you'll install on your computer
- a browser "connector" so that you can save to Zotero from your browser
  advanced uses (notes, indexing, tagging, etc.)

We'll call the citations you save in Zotero your **library**, but it is more like a database. You'll need to create a user account that will allow you to sync your library across multiple devices. Zotero stores your information centrally (we call this the Zotero server), and when you add or edit items in your library you will want to **sync** the changes to the Zotero server, so that your library is updated on all of your devices. 

*Note: the Zotero website is not the same as the Zotero application. The website allows you to access your library without installing the application, like if you are working in the library and just want to look up a reference that you'd saved earlier. **The online library doesn't have all of the features we'll be discussing in this tutorial.***
